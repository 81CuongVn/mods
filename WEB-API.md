 # How to get the path
 
 Here is our example

Interact with it here! https://jsonblob.com/

Lets say we wanted to get the **"b"** object from that ( the highlighted one )

the path to the **"b"** object would be  **"object.object.a"**

the path to the **"Hello World"** string would be **"object.string"**

the path to the **"123"** would be **"object.number"**

To pull an object from the array, it would be **object.array[0]** for 1, **array[1]** for 2, and **array[2]** for 3"
Instead of **array.0** its **array[0]**.

**When typing these into the path, always ignore the root variable as thats already there.**

so if you wanted the path to output **"Hello World"**, you would type  **string**  into the path textbox. (removing **object.** from it)

Have fun!
